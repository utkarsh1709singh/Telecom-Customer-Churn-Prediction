### *Telecom Customer Churn Prediction*
## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques, specifically a decision tree classifier. The script provided generates a synthetic dataset simulating customer data and demonstrates the implementation of a decision tree model for predicting churn based on customer features such as age, monthly charge, and customer service calls.

## Description
The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in a telecom company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses, especially in competitive industries like telecommunications, as it helps in identifying at-risk customers and implementing targeted retention strategies to mitigate churn rates.

This project utilizes a decision tree classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on various features such as age, monthly charge, and customer service calls. The decision tree model is trained on a synthetic dataset generated to simulate customer data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.

## Key Components
* Data Generation: A synthetic dataset is created to simulate customer data, including features related to customer demographics, usage patterns, and interaction with customer service.
* Model Training: The decision tree classifier is trained on the dataset to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the churn status of customers.
* Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate testing dataset to assess its performance in predicting customer churn. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy are used to measure the model's effectiveness.
* Visualization: A visualization of the decision tree is generated to provide insights into how the model makes predictions and which features are most influential in determining customer churn.
* By accurately predicting customer churn, telecom companies can proactively identify and address issues that may lead to customer dissatisfaction, thereby improving customer retention rates and ultimately enhancing business profitability.

## Usage
To run the project and perform customer churn prediction:
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
* Run the Python script telecom_customer_churn_prediction.py.
* The script will generate a synthetic dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train a decision tree classifier, make predictions on the test set, evaluate the model's accuracy, and visualize the decision tree.
